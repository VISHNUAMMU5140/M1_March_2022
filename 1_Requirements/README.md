# RESISTANCE CALCULATION PROGRAM
#### This is a program built for electronics engineers mainly for calculating the resistance inside the circuit.
#### As we all know the circuits are built across two configurations - Series and Parallel.
#### This program enables us to calculate the resistance value for both configurations according to user input.
#### This program has the capability to calculate any number of resistors.
