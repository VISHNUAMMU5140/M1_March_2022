# RESISTANCE CALCULATION PROGRAM
#### This is a program built for electronics engineers mainly for calculating the resistance inside the circuit.
#### As we all know the circuits are built across two configurations - Series and Parallel.
#### This program enables us to calculate the resistance value for both configurations according to user input.
#### This program has the capability to calculate for any number of resistors.


# SWOT ANALYSIS
## STRENGTH:
* USEFUL FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS FOR EASY CALCULATION
* SIMPLE USER INTERFACE

## WEAKNESS:
* ONLY APPLICABLE FOR SERIES AND PARALLEL CALCULATION

## OPPORTUNITIES:
* IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED FOR MANY ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS FORMULAE IN FUTURE

## THREAT:
* PROGRAM CAN BE HACKED AS NO SECURITY IS PROVIDED
* ANYONE CAN ACCESS THE PROGRAM

# 4W'S AND 1'H:
## WHO:
* THIS GAME IS USEFUL FOR ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS

## WHAT:
* THIS PROGRAM CALCULATES SERIES AND PARALLE RESISTANCE ACCORDING TO USER INPUT

## WHEN:
* IT WORKS ON THE BASIS OF USER INPUT(WHENEVER REQUIRED)

## WHY:
* IT DECREASES TIME AND EFFORT IN CALCULATING THE RESISTANCES

## HOW:
* WHEN USER ENTERS WHETHER SERIES OR PARALLEL, AND ENTERS THE NO. OF RESISTANCE AND THE VALUE FOR IT.THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATES THE VALUE AND RETUENS IT,

# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
* HLR1 - VISUAL STUDIO CODE - SOFTWARE
* HLR2 - WINDOWS OR LINUX OS - SOFTWARE

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
* LLR_01 - NUMBER OF REISTANCE
* LLR_02 - REISTANCE VALUE
* LLR_03 - SERIES FUNCTION TESTING
* LLR_04 - PARALLEL FUNCTION TESTING
